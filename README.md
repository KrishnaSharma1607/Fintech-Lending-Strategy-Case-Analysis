# Fintech Lending Strategy Case Analysis – RupayPay Technologies

This repository contains my submission for **Case Forge 2025**, a national-level case competition organized by **E-Cell, IIT Kharagpur** in collaboration with **Masters’ Union**.  
The case revolved around **RupayPay Technologies**, an Indian fintech lender at a crossroads: whether to continue **bootstrapping** or accept **VC funding** to scale aggressively.  


## 📌 Problem Statement
RupayPay, a bootstrapped SME-focused lending fintech, had achieved strong growth but faced capital constraints amid rising competition from well-funded rivals.  
The challenge was to recommend the best strategic path forward by evaluating:  
1. **Strategic Recommendation** – Bootstrapping vs. VC funding.  
2. **Trade-offs & Risk Analysis** – Operational, financial, cultural, and regulatory dimensions.  
3. **Scenario Models** – Revenue, EBITDA, NPAs, loan book, SME base, and cash burn across both paths.  
4. **Execution Plan** – Key battles and risk mitigants under each approach.

## 📊 My Solution
I proposed a **Hybrid Growth Strategy**:  
- **Phase I (0–24 months)** – Continue lean bootstrapped growth with disciplined capital use, SME referrals, partnerships, and smart risk management.  
- **Phase II (post-24 months)** – Raise VC capital at a stronger valuation to scale nationally, diversify offerings, and strengthen infrastructure.  

**Key Highlights of the Solution Deck:**  
- **SWOT & Porter’s Five Forces** applied to assess market positioning and scalability.  
- **Risk Radar & Scorecard** comparing NPAs, EBITDA margins, cash burn, and growth speed (Excel).  
- **Scenario Models** – Built bootstrapped vs. VC-backed financial forecasts with revenue CAGR, SME base, penetration, and ticket size (Power BI).  
- **Execution Plan** – Identified risks (capital crunch, regulatory shifts, deep-pocketed rivals, NPAs) and designed mitigation strategies through:  
  - **Lean Tech Power** – Lightweight app with multilingual UI, instant loan tracker, GST tools, and AI chatbot as RupayPay’s key differentiator.  
  - **Employer Magnet** – ESOPs, flexible work, and impact-driven culture to attract & retain top fintech talent.  
  - **Capital-Efficient Growth** – Referral-led SME onboarding, distributor tie-ups, and AI-driven underwriting to scale sustainably.  
  - **Customer Lock-in** – Loyalty rewards, embedded SaaS tools, and financial literacy programs to boost stickiness.  
  - **Capital Partnerships** – Co-lending alliances, SIDBI/CGTMSE credit lines, and embedded financing via ONDC/distributors.
